I made it using Java language. 
First you need to import that project into one of Java development programs (for example Eclipse).
Then run project.
You will have to choose a number of array elements.
Next you can enter any numbers into you array.
Finally you will get your array shown with an answer (true/false) witch means is it winnable or not.
